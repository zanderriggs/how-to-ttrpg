# Non-Standard <br/>Combat Rules

## Mounted Combat
A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

### Mounting and Dismounting
Once during your move, you can mount or dismount a creature that is within 5 feet of you. **Mounting or dismounting costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.** For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a **DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount,** landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, **you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet.** Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.

### Controlling a Mount
While mounted, you have two options. You can either:
- -Control the mount. (No Action required)
- -Allow it to act independently. 

Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: **Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.** A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

## Cover

### Half Cover
A target with half cover has a **+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.**

### Three-Quarters Cover
A target with three-quarters cover has a **+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.**

### Total Cover
**A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell,** although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.

## Underwater Combat
When making a **melee weapon attack,** a creature without a swim speed has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is one of the following: dagger, javalin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses any targets beyond the weapons normal range (the first number in it's range increment). Within normal range, the ranged attack has disadvantage unless the weapon is one of the following: crossbow, net, spear, trident, or dart.

Additionally, creatures and objects fully submerged in water have a **resistance to fire damage.**
