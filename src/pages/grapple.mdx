[Home](/)

Ready to rassle?

### In order to grapple you must:

- Use the attack action to make a special melee attack (the grapple).
    - If you have multiple attacks, this replaces one of them.
- Be no more than one size smaller than your target.
- Have at least one free hand.
- Make a **Strength(Athletics)** check contested by the targets **Strength(Athletics)** or **Dexterity(Acrobatics)** check.

If you succeed, the target is subject to the [Grappled](/conditions) condition. It is a free action to release the target.

## Escaping a Grapple
A grappled creature may use it's action to escape.

Make a **Strength(Athletics)** or **Dexterity(Acrobatics)** check contested by your opponents **Strength(Athletics)** check.

## Moving a Grappled Creature
When you move, you can drag or carry a Grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

## Shoving a Creature
### In order to shove a creature, you must:

- Use the Attack action to make a special melee attack (the shove). 
    - If you have multiple attacks, this replaces one of them.
- Be no more than one size smaller than your target.
- Make a **Strength(Athletics)** check contested by the targets **Strength(Athletics)** or **Dexterity(Acrobatics)** check.

If you succeed, you either knock the target [Prone](/conditions) or push it 5 feet away from you.

>**_NOTE:_** You don't need a free hand to shove a target.

## Climb onto a Bigger Creature
To climb a creature bigger than you, you must:
- Be at least two sizes smaller than your target.
- Make a successful grapple check (**Strength(Athletics)** or **Dexterity(Acrobatics)** check contested by the targets **Dexterity(Acrobatics)**)

**If successful:** The smaller creature:
- Moves into the larger creatures space.
- Moves with the target as long as the grapple is maintained.
- Has advantage on attack rolls against the larger creature.
- May move around the learger creatures space,treatign the space as difficult terrain.

**Alternatively:** If the opponent is suitably large, it could be treated as difficult terrain for the purposed of jumping on it's back or clinging to a limb.

#### What the larger grappled creature may do is up to GM discretion. For Example:

**While Grappled, the larger creature may:**
- Attack the smaller creature, perhaps depending on thier position.
- Dislodge the smaller creature as an Action by making a **Strength(Athletics)** check contested by the smaller creatures  **Strength(Athletics)** or **Dexterity(Acrobatics)** check.
